## Description

**IMPORTANT**: If you are just starting to learn how to use PyLith or wanting to run PyLith on a laptop or workstation, then we highly recommend using the binary packages. Installation instructions for binary packages are available in the PyLith manual available from the [PyLith webpage](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith/) on the [CIG website](https://geodynamics.org).

This installer builds the current PyLith release and its dependencies from source.
